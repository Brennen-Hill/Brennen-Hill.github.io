Project Report 2: 3D Robotic Simulation & Analysis Platform

Project: High-Fidelity 3D Simulation and Visualization Platform
Project Lead: Sole Developer
Period: June 2025 â€“ Present (Concurrent with Project 1)

1. Objective

To design and implement a high-fidelity 3D simulation and analysis platform for the company's mobile robotics platform. The primary goals were to create a robust testbed for R&D of new autonomous features (including the State Estimation algorithm) and to provide a company-wide tool for performance analysis, mission review, and debugging of navigation systems.

2. Features & Implementation

The simulation platform was developed using Unreal Engine, leveraging both C++ for core logic and Blueprints for rapid iteration and UI/control implementation.

Key features include:

Mission Reconstruction: The tool ingests historical mission data ("snake data") to reconstruct the robot's complete trajectory in a high-fidelity 3D environment, accurately rendering the relevant 3D terrain.

Comprehensive State Visualization: The simulator provides a real-time, dynamic visualization of the platform's complete state, including its 3D position, orientation (angle), speed, velocity, acceleration, and associated sensor data.

Advanced Controls: Integrates extensive user controls, allowing operators to view the simulation from multiple camera perspectives (e.g., chase, free-look, sensor-view) and toggle the visualization of different data layers and system-state variables.

3. Impact & Current Use

R&D Testbed: The platform serves as a critical testbed for designing, iterating on, and validating new features. It was instrumental in the development of the High-Precision State Estimation system.

Company-Wide Analysis Tool: The simulator is available to the entire company and is actively used by researchers and engineers. It provides an intuitive and powerful interface to visually analyze system performance, review mission data, and identify and debug complex issues in the platform's navigation and autonomous programs.
