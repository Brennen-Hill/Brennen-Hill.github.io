Project Report 1: Novel Embodied AI for High-Precision State Estimation

Project: Development of a Hardware-Aware State Estimation System
Project Lead: Sole Researcher & Engineer
Period: May 2025 â€“ Present

1. Objective

To spearhead the complete research and development lifecycle for a novel, on-device artificial intelligence system to enable high-precision autonomous navigation for the company's mobile robotics platform. The primary challenge was to achieve high-accuracy state estimation using resource-constrained sensors, overcoming the significant performance limitations of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms on this specific hardware.

2. Methodology & Development

The project progressed through a rigorous, multi-stage R&D pipeline:

Literature Review & Benchmarking: Conducted a comprehensive review of SOTA methodologies for position location and state estimation, including algorithms detailed in the Handbook of Position Location. Key SOTA algorithms were implemented and benchmarked on the platform's hardware.

Problem Analysis: Benchmarking revealed that existing SOTA algorithms were ill-suited for the platform's operational constraints. These methods, largely designed for high-fidelity sensors or stationary receivers, yielded state estimation accuracy of only ~1000 meters, which was insufficient for reliable navigation.

Novel Algorithm Design: A custom, hardware-aware algorithm was devised to address these specific shortcomings. The core innovation lies in its use of manifold disentanglement to re-frame the high-dimensional localization problem. Instead of attempting to solve for a 3D position directly from noisy sensor data, the algorithm first isolates and determines key individual parameters (such as distance-to-feature), effectively reducing the problem's dimensionality. This approach proved far more robust to the high noise and low accuracy of the platform's sensor suite.

Dynamic Platform Accommodation: A key differentiator of this custom solution is that it was designed from the ground up to account for a dynamic, mobile platform. This is a significant departure from many SOTA methods that assume stationary receivers.

Implementation: The system was developed using a dual-language approach. Python was used for data pipelines, initial prototyping, simulation, and benchmarking. The final, high-performance, on-device algorithm was implemented in Lisp to leverage its exceptional speed, low-level customizability, and real-time metaprogramming capabilities for debugging and iteration.

Validation: A rigorous validation pipeline was built to test the algorithm against a massive set of historical flight data. The system was validated first in high-fidelity simulation and subsequently through extensive on-hardware performance analysis to prove its real-world robustness.

3. Results & Impact

Performance: The final algorithm achieves state estimation accuracy to within 10 meters, a greater than 100x improvement over the ~1000-meter accuracy of benchmarked SOTA solutions.

Deployment: The system is fully production-ready and has been deployed on every device the company produces. It is a core component of the platform's autonomous navigation stack, available to all customers and internal teams.

Communication: Findings, progress, and results were communicated directly to the immediate team, the entire company, and the CEO.

4. Current & Future Work

Research is currently being extended to develop a system for state-anchoring from persistent environmental features. This system will identify and create a persistent library of environmental signals, enabling the platform to re-identify them. This capability will provide an absolute grounding anchor for the robot's position, further enhancing navigation precision and long-term reliability.
