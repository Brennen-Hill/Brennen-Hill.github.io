# **Part I: System Architecture and Codebase Analysis**

This section provides an exhaustive analysis of the provided codebase for the "Thunder Warrior: Genesis" (TWG) game. The analysis covers the frontend structure, client-side logic, server-side game management, and the core game mechanics as implemented in the code.

## **I. Frontend Implementation (`client.html`, CSS)**

The `client.html` file serves as the entry point and primary structure for the game's user interface (UI), specifically the main menu and character management screens.

### **A. HTML Structure and Metadata**

- **Document Type**: Standard HTML5 doctype (`<!DOCTYPE html>`).
- **Head Section**:
  - **Title**: "TWG Menu - Thunder Warrior: Genesis".
  - **Favicons**: A comprehensive set of favicons (`apple-touch-icon`, `icon`, `manifest`, `mask-icon`, `shortcut icon`) and meta tags for platform-specific branding (Microsoft Tile, `theme-color`).
  - **Inline CSS**: A substantial inline `<style>` block defines the application's visual appearance.
  - **JavaScript**: Links to `clientWebsocket.js` and includes a large inline `<script>` block containing the primary client-side menu logic.
- **Body Section**:
  - **Styling and Events**: Sets a dark background (`#010105`) and attaches an `onresize` event handler for dynamic layout adjustments.
  - **Main Containers**: The UI is segmented into several top-level `div` elements, each representing a distinct screen, managed via JavaScript:
    - `loadingPage`: Displays loading indicators.
    - `classSelectionScreen`: Interface for initial attribute allocation.
    - `homeScreen`: The main menu hub.
    - `weaponPage`: Screen for weapon/modification management.
    - `abilityPage`: Screen for ability management.
    - `shopScreen`: Interface for purchasing items.
    - `settingsScreen`: Modal overlay for account/game options.
    - `rewardsScreen`: Modal for displaying earned rewards.
    - `upgradeAbilityScreen`: Modal for level-up ability upgrades.
    - `statsScreen`: Modal for detailed statistics.
    - `gameModeSelectionBackground`/`gameModeSelectionTab`: UI for game mode selection.
    - `tellScreen`: Generic modal for informational messages.
    - `descriptionBackground`: Pop-up element for item tooltips.
  - **Templates**: Utilizes HTML `<template>` tags (`purchaseTemplate`, `paymentScreenTemplate`, etc.) for dynamic generation of repetitive UI elements (e.g., shop items).
  - **Visibility**: Most screens are initially hidden (`visibility: hidden`) and toggled by JavaScript.
  - **IFrame**: Includes an `iframe` with `src='https://thunderwarrior.org/iframe'`, likely for cross-domain authentication or data retrieval.
  - **Form**: Contains a hidden `form` (`startForm`) used to POST data when transitioning to the game client.

### **B. CSS Styling**

- **Units and Responsiveness**: Extensively uses `vmin` (viewport-minimum) for sizing and positioning, enabling proportional scaling of the UI.
- **Layout**: Primarily uses `position: absolute` for screen-level layout within a fixed-size container ($100vmin \times 100vmin$). Flexbox (`display: flex`) is used for alignment within specific components (e.g., `informationBar`).
- **Visual Appearance**:
  - **Color Scheme**: A dark, futuristic/sci-fi palette (dark blues, purples, grays) with highlights (white, yellow, green, red).
  - **Gradients**: Employs `linear-gradient` and `radial-gradient` for buttons and effects.
  - **Borders and Radius**: Heavy use of `border-radius` for rounded and circular elements.
  - **Transparency/Overlays**: Uses `rgba` colors for semi-transparent modal backgrounds.
- **Interactivity & Animation**:
  - **Hover Effects**: Provides visual feedback on `:hover` for interactive elements.
  - **Animations**: Uses CSS `@keyframes` (`spin`, `pulseAnimation`) for loading indicators and UI effects.
  - **Transitions**: Employs CSS `transition` for smooth property changes (e.g., `opacity`).
- **Scrollbars**: Customizes scrollbar appearance using `::-webkit-scrollbar`.
- **User Interaction**: Disables text selection (`user-select: none`) to maintain a game-like interface.

## **II. Client-Side Logic (`client.html` `<script>`, `clientWebsocket.js`)**

The client-side JavaScript manages UI state, handles user interactions, and orchestrates WebSocket communication with the server.

### **A. Initialization and Authentication**

1.  **Loading Sequence**: On window load, `runGame` $\rightarrow$ `loadGame` requests account credentials from the `iframe` (`getAccount`).
2.  **Credential Handling**: An `onmessage` handler receives credentials (`username`, `password`) from the iframe. If successful, it stores them and calls `load`.
3.  **WebSocket Connection (`clientWebsocket.js`)**: `load` calls `createWebSocket`.
    - `createWebSocket` establishes the connection and sets up `onopen`, `onerror`, `onmessage`, and `onclose` handlers.
    - `messageWS` handles incoming messages, performing an initial security check (`checkMessage`) involving a key exchange and timestamp verification.
    - Upon a successful check, a `ticket` is stored, and an 'account' message is sent (`sendAccount`) with credentials.
4.  **Data Loading**:
    - The server responds with a 'user' message containing player data (`user`), game `options`, and `status`.
    - `recieveAnyMessage` routes this to `loadAll` (in `client.html`).
    - `loadAll` stores the data in the global `troop` variable, initializes game definitions (equipment, abilities), and begins loading images (`createAllImages`).
5.  **Image Loading**: `createAllImages` tracks image loading progress and updates the `loadStatus` element.
6.  **Final Setup**: Once images are loaded, `continuePageCreationWithLoadedImages` sets up event listeners, updates UI displays, checks if class selection is needed, and finally hides the loading screen.

### **B. UI Management and Navigation**

- **Screen Visibility**: A global `onPage` variable tracks the active screen. Functions like `showHomeScreen` and `hideHomeScreen` manipulate the `visibility` style property to navigate.
- **Dynamic Content**:
  - **Templates**: Uses `<template>` elements to dynamically generate lists (shop items, class selectors).
  - **Resource Display**: `updateResources` updates UI text for currency, experience, etc.
  - **Character Display**: Updates `img` sources and draws the character model onto a canvas (`drawFullCharacter`).
  - **Tooltips**: `showWeaponDescription` and `showAbilityDescription` populate and position the `descriptionBackground` element with item details.

### **C. Core Menu Logic**

- **Class Selection**: Manages the initial attribute point allocation screen (`classSelectionScreen`). `modifyClassOption` handles point distribution, and `selectClass` finalizes the choices, sending them to the server (`saveTraitToServer`).
- **Home Screen**: The central hub displaying character, resources, and equipment. Clickable elements navigate to other screens (Weapon, Ability, Shop).
- **Weapon/Equipment Page (`weaponPage`)**: Displays details for `selectedEquipment`. Allows equipping/deconstructing items and managing equipped modifications (`displayOrHideModOptions`).
- **Ability Page (`abilityPage`)**: Displays the Stamina and Thaumaturgy ability trees. `createAbilityOption` dynamically generates icons. Handles unlocking (`setUnlockButton`), equipping (`equipAbility`), and displaying ability details.
- **Shop Page (`shopScreen`)**: Tabbed interface for different item categories. `setShopScreen` renders purchase options onto canvases. `makePurchase` handles the transaction logic.
- **Starting Game**: `showGameModeSelection` displays game modes. `startGame` packages necessary data (`getGameData`) and uses `sessionStorage` and form submission (`joinGame`) to transition to the game client.

### **D. Data Management**

- **Global `troop` Object**: Holds all player-specific data received from the server.
- **Equipment/Ability Definitions**: Contains extensive static data definitions for all base equipment, modifications, and abilities, including stats, costs, and prerequisites.
- **Calculations**: Includes functions to calculate modified stats based on mods (`getModifiedEquipment`), item power (`getPower`), and dynamic ability descriptions (`getAbilityDescription`).
- **Server Synchronization**: The `saveTraitToServer` function sends updates via WebSocket whenever persistent data changes (e.g., equipping items, unlocking abilities).

---

## **III. Server-Side Logic (`gameServer.js`, `websocket.js`)**

The server manages game instances, handles client communication within games, and runs the core game simulation.

### **A. Game Instance Management (`gameServer.js`)**

- **`NEW_GAME` Constructor**: Represents a single game instance (room). It is initialized with game configuration (`game`), WebSocket utilities (`w`, `wss`), and termination callbacks.
- **Initialization**: Stores map data, creates `Trooper` objects for each player (`buildTroopers`), initializes projectiles, and sets up `CollisionDetection`.
- **Game Loop**:
  - Executes at a fixed tick rate (`fps`).
  - Calculates delta time (`setDeltaTime`).
  - Updates all troopers and projectiles (`updateGame`).
  - Checks for win/end conditions (`checkWin`).
  - Broadcasts the updated state to all clients (`sendUpdate`).
- **Termination**:
  - `checkWin` monitors trooper `alive` status and affiliation counts. If conditions are met (one team remaining, disconnects, timeout), it calls `gameOver` or `endGame`.
  - `gameOver` records the winner and calls the `finishGame` callback.
  - `endGame` stops the game loop (`clearInterval`) and calls the `terminateGame` callback.

### **B. Client Communication (`gameServer.js`, `websocket.js`)**

- **Input Handling**: The `newInput` method receives player input from the WebSocket server and forwards it to the corresponding `Trooper` object.
- **Connection Management**: `disconnect` and `rejoin` methods update the `connected` status of `Trooper` objects.
- **State Synchronization**: `sendUpdate` gathers state data from all `Trooper` and `Projectile` objects (via their `.data` getters) and broadcasts it to the room using `w.sendToRooms`.
- **WebSocket Utilities (`websocket.js`)**: Provides helper functions for sending messages, managing room membership, handling keep-alive pings, and verifying client connections.

### **C. Server-Side Game Logic**

- **Simulation**: The `updateGame` function orchestrates the simulation tick:
  1.  Calls `prepare` on all troopers (updates delta time, processes input, updates status effects/abilities).
  2.  Calls `update` on all troopers (handles movement, combat, physics).
  3.  Calls `update` on all projectiles (movement, collision checks).
  4.  Calls `reset` on all troopers (clears temporary multipliers).
- **Object Management**: Maintains lists of `troopers` and `projectiles`.

---

## **IV. Core Gameplay Object Analysis**

These files define the fundamental objects and rules of the game simulation.

### **A. Character (`Trooper.js`)**

- **Representation**: The central class representing a player in the game world.
- **State**: Maintains extensive state, including position ($x$, $y$, $z$), rotation (`rot`), dimensions ($w$, $h$, $d$), velocity, core stats (HP, Stamina, Thaumaturgy), affiliation, status, equipped weapons, active abilities, status effects, input state, and animation flags.
- **Physics/Movement**: Implements gravity, acceleration/deceleration, jumping (including variable height), running, and collision response (`boxCollision`).
- **Combat**: Handles damage application (`damage` method), defense calculations, critical hits, and evasion. Tracks health and death state. Delegates combat actions to `Gun` and `Saber` instances.
- **Resources**: Manages HP, Stamina, and Thaumaturgy, including current/max values, regeneration rates, and cooldowns.
- **Abilities**: Manages the activation, execution, and cooldown of abilities, interacting with `AbilityEffect.js`.
- **Status Effects**: Manages applied status effects via the `status` array, interacting with `StatusEffect.js` to modify multipliers (`troop.mult`).
- **Data Serialization**: The `.data` getter packages essential state for network synchronization.

### **B. Weapons (`Gun.js`, `Saber.js`, `WeaponBase.js`)**

- **Common Base (`WeaponBase.js`)**: Provides shared logic for firing/action cooldowns (`firingSpeed`), resource management (`heat`), and activation state.
- **Ranged Weapons (`Gun.js`)**:
  - Handles firing logic, heat tracking, firing rate, and spread.
  - Creates `Projectile` instances.
  - Supports special shots activated by abilities.
- **Melee Weapons (`Saber.js`)**:
  - **Striking**: Manages strike cooldowns, delays, and applies damage within an arc using collision detection.
  - **Blocking**: Manages block state, duration, and parry window. Handles projectile reflection (`blockProjectile`) and melee deflection (`blockSaber`) based on angle checks. Consumes stamina.
- **Projectiles (`Projectile.js`)**:
  - Represents individual shots. Moves in a straight line, checks for collisions (`CD.check`), and applies damage with falloff. Expires after exceeding `maxRange`.

### **C. Abilities and Status Effects (`AbilityEffect.js`, `StatusEffect.js`)**

- **Ability Logic (`AbilityEffect.js`)**: Contains the specific server-side implementation for each ability, defining activation logic, per-tick updates, and end conditions.
- **Status Effect Logic (`StatusEffect.js`)**: Defines how temporary buffs and debuffs modify a trooper's state or behavior over time, typically by modifying `troop.mult` properties.

### **D. Physics and Collision (`CollisionDetection.js`, `MathVector.js`)**

- **Collision Detection (`CollisionDetection.js`)**: Provides functions for checking intersections between shapes (AABB boxes, planes, arcs) used for movement, projectiles, and abilities.
- **Vector Math (`MathVector.js`)**: Includes utilities for vector rotation, normalization, and direction calculation.
- **Trooper Physics (`Trooper.js`)**: Implements basic physics, including gravity, acceleration, and collision response.

### **E. Map Generation (`mapBuilder.js`)**

- Defines maps as arrays of obstacle objects and structured spawn position data.
- Selects a map and assigns spawn points to players based on affiliation.

---

## **V. Overall Architecture and Observations**

- **Client-Server Model**: The project follows an authoritative server model. The server (`gameServer.js`) runs the simulation, while clients send input and receive state updates via WebSockets.
- **Modularity**: The codebase is reasonably modular, with separation of concerns (e.g., `Trooper.js`, `Gun.js`, `gameServer.js`, `client.html`).
- **Object-Oriented Elements**: Utilizes constructor functions and prototypes to create classes for game entities.
- **State Management**: State is managed primarily within `Trooper` objects on the server and synchronized. The client menu maintains its own UI state and player data (`troop` object).
- **Data Definitions**: A significant amount of static game data (weapon stats, ability definitions) is defined directly within the JavaScript files. This could be externalized (e.g., to JSON) for easier management.
- **Complexity**: The `Trooper.js`, `client.html` (inline script), and `AbilityEffect.js` files are notably large and complex, handling a wide range of interconnected logic.

# **Part III: Web Portal and Community Infrastructure**

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the project's web portal, based on an extensive review of 128 HTML message and article files from the `homeMessages` directory.

## **I. Overview of Web Portal**

The "Thunder Warrior: Genesis" project is supported by a robust web portal that serves as the central hub for account management, community news, and user feedback. The portal is currently supporting an open beta, with a strong emphasis on community-driven development.

Analysis of the `homeMessages` files reveals a modular client-side notification system. This system uses JavaScript functions (e.g., `setMessage()`, `setArticle()`, `newSection()`) to dynamically load static HTML snippets, which serve as user notifications, error messages, and news articles. This architecture allows for easily updatable, non-blocking user communication.

## **II. User Account Management System**

The project features an exceptionally thorough and secure account management system, with specific error handling for nearly every possible user state.

### **A. Account Sign Up (Registration)**

- **Validation**: Checks for empty fields, password mismatch, password length ($>$7 chars, alphanumeric), and username length ($<$20 chars, alphanumeric).
- **Conflict Handling**: Provides distinct error messages if the username is taken, the email is taken, or if the username is taken but the associated email is unconfirmed.
- **Status Handling**: Blocks registration for usernames associated with banned or deleted accounts.
- **Success**: Informs the user that a confirmation code has been sent.

### **B. Account Sign In (Authentication)**

- **Validation**: Checks for empty fields and incorrect credentials.
- **Account Status**:
  - **Unconfirmed**: Allows sign-in but informs the user a new confirmation code has been sent.
  - **Banned/Deleted**: Blocks sign-in and directs to "Contact Us".
- **One-Time Password (OTP)**: Handles OTPs from password resets, with specific errors for expired ($>$1 hour) or previously used codes.

### **C. Account Confirmation**

- **Validation**: Checks for incorrect, expired, or already-confirmed codes.
- **Resending**: Allows users to request a new code, with validation to ensure it's for a pre-existing account.

### **D. Account Recovery (Forgot Password/Username)**

- **Validation**: Checks for empty fields and non-existent accounts.
- **Status Handling**: Blocks recovery for unconfirmed or banned accounts.
- **Success**:
  - **Username**: Sends the username to the account's email.
  - **Password**: Sends a one-time-use password, valid for one hour, and explicitly instructs the user to change it immediately.

### **E. Account Information Editing**

- **Validation**: Requires correct current credentials. Enforces all password and username rules for new values.
- **Conflict Handling**: Prevents users from changing to an already-taken username or email.
- **Redundancy Check**: Prevents updates if the new information is identical to the old.
- **Email Change**: On successful email change, informs the user they must re-confirm with a new code.

### **F. Account Deletion & Banning**

- **User Deletion**: Allows users to irreversibly delete their own accounts.
- **Banned Status**: A "banned" status prevents all account activity (sign-in, feedback, rating, editing) across the entire portal.
- **Admin Tools**: A "Deletion Code" module exists, suggesting an administrative back-end for account banning.

## **III. Gameplay and Feature Onboarding**

News articles within the portal detail the game's core mechanics for players.

- **Classes**: Players choose a class (e.g., Jedi, Sith, Infiltrator) which defines starting skills (Power, Constitution, Thaumaturgy, etc.), faction (Empire/Rebellion), passive traits, and starting equipment.
- **Equipment**:
  - **Slots**: Helmet, Torso, Legs, Right/Left Arm, Ranged Weapon, Melee Weapon.
  - **Rarity**: A 7-tier system (Junk, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Insane) affects stats.
  - **Acquisition**: Dropped by enemies or acquired from the shop using "credits and metal".
- **Modifications System**: A core customization feature.
  - **Structure**: Mods have one "Main Enhancement" (e.g., Defense) and up to four "Minor Enhancements" (secondary stats or "Universal Changes" like ability cost).
  - **Balancing**: Minor enhancements can be a "slight Decrease" to balance more powerful traits on the same mod.
- **Combat System**:
  - **Melee**: Introduced as a major update. Players press 'f' to swap. Melee attacks are high-damage but slow.
  - **Blocking**: Holding 'shift' with a melee weapon reflects projectiles and staggers melee attackers.
- **Game World**: Gameplay occurs on various planets (Julix IV, Athemorum, Frin'Sai, Tralion Catornay), each with a unique map and environment.

## **IV. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Analysis**

The news articles document a significant, ongoing effort to refine the UI/UX.

- **Web Page Redesign**: The entire website was "completely revamped" with a new persistent navigation bar, a side menu, and optimized images for reduced loading.
- **Home Page Remodeling**: The main character dashboard was redesigned to feature a central preview of the player's character, surrounded by clickable icons for each equipment slot.
- **In-Game UI ("Information Update")**:
  - **Status Bars**: HP, Stamina, Thaumaturgy, and Heat bars were updated to show exact numerical values (current/max).
  - **Detailed Stats**: A hover-over system shows key stats, while a "detailed view" provides an extended list of "over twenty different stats" for equipment.
- **Game Error Handling**: A dedicated set of messages (`startGameMessage`) handles all game-joining errors, including "not signed in," "banned," "already signed in" (with an option to kick the other session), "failed to rejoin," and "match ended."

## **V. Community Feedback and Engagement Systems**

The project utilizes four distinct systems for data collection and user engagement. All systems (except "Contact Us") require the user to be signed in and confirmed.

1.  **Feedback System**: For bugs, ideas, and general comments.
    - **Validation**: Checks for empty "Topic and Message" fields.
    - **Rate Limiting**: "we only allow one Feedback Message to be sent once per Five Minutes."
    - **Admin Function**: Contains hidden messages ("Failed to reset account," "Successfully reset account") suggesting a debug tool.
2.  **Rating System**: A simple 1-5 star rating. Users can submit, update, or delete their rating.
3.  **Review System**: A more detailed system with a title and message body. Users can submit, update, or delete their review.
4.  **"Contact Us" System**: A public-facing form (First/Last Name, Email, Topic, Message) for users who cannot sign in.

## **VI. Technical Infrastructure and Development Pipeline**

The news articles provide transparent insight into the project's backend architecture and development roadmap.

- **Server Architecture**: A "Server is Completely Revamped" update announced a major architectural shift.
  - **Change**: "We have moved client side data updating function over to the server."
  - **New Model**: The client is now responsible primarily for rendering, while the server handles the authoritative simulation.
  - **Result**: This change "greatly reduced" lag and input delay, signifying a critical move from a client-authoritative to a server-authoritative model.
- **3D Graphics & Animation Pipeline**: The project is undergoing a major graphical overhaul from 2D to 3D. The "How We Create Our Characters" article details their 5-step pipeline:
  1.  **First Steps**: Idea and lore-fitting.
  2.  **Design**: Reference images and concept art.
  3.  **Modelling**: Building, texturing, and animating the 3D model.
  4.  **Customizability**: Splitting the model into interchangeable parts (head, torso, arms, legs, weapons).
  5.  **Implementation**: Capturing thousands of images of the 3D model from all angles, which are composited in-game to create the custom character.
- **Development Status**: The project is in open beta, with developers reporting high community investment and positive feedback. Future work includes an announced UI redesign and ongoing 3D asset integration.
