Project 1: Novel Hardware-Aware Algorithm for High-Precision State Estimation

Role: Sole Research Engineer

Objective

To research, design, and deploy a production-ready system for high-precision state estimation on a mobile robotics platform. The project began as an ambiguous high-level goal and was delivered as a fully-deployed, mission-critical system.

Challenges

The primary challenge was the severe limitations of the platform's on-board sensors, which provide low-accuracy data.

SOTA Benchmarking: I conducted a comprehensive literature review, implementing and benchmarking numerous state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms (e.g., from the Handbook of Position Location, Second Edition).

Performance Gaps: These SOTA methods failed to produce viable results, as they are fundamentally designed for high-fidelity sensors. Furthermore, they are optimized for stationary receivers, whereas our platform is highly dynamic and mobile.

Methodology & Solution

Given the failure of existing methods, I devised a custom, hardware-aware algorithm from first principles.

Manifold Disentanglement: The core innovation of the algorithm is a novel manifold disentanglement technique. Instead of attempting to solve the high-dimensional state estimation problem in one step (which is highly sensitive to noise), my solution first reframes the problem onto a lower-dimensional manifold. This intermediate step is robust to the high-noise sensor data, and its output is then used to solve the full state estimation problem,

Prototyping & Validation: I developed initial prototypes in Python to validate the theory against simulated data. After achieving success, I built a robust data pipeline to ingest, process, and replay historical telemetry data from thousands of real-world operational runs, allowing for massive-scale regression testing.

Production Implementation: The final, high-performance algorithm was implemented in Lisp. This system was rigorously validated through a multi-stage pipeline, progressing from high-fidelity simulation to extensive on-hardware performance analysis to prove its real-world robustness.

Technology Stack

Lisp: Used for the core, on-device, high-performance algorithm. Lisp was selected for its high-speed execution, low-level customizability, and powerful metaprogramming capabilities, which enabled rapid debugging and iterative development directly on the running system.

Python: Used for all data pipelines, simulation, benchmarking, prototyping, and testing.

Results & Impact

Performance: The custom algorithm achieved a 100-fold improvement in state estimation accuracy over the SOTA baseline, reducing localization error from ~1000 meters to under 10 meters.

Deployment: The system is now deployed on 100% of the company's devices and is a foundational component of the platform's autonomous capabilities.

Ongoing Work: I am currently leading the effort to extend this system's capabilities for "state-anchoring"â€”identifying and tracking persistent environmental features to provide a consistent global reference frame.
