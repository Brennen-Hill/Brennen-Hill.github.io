As a dedicated researcher at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, my research has been a focused exploration of a central question: How can the principles of computation in biological substrates provide a blueprint for engineering artificial intelligence?

My research experience spans multiple labs, focusing on brain-inspired AI, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and foundation models. I founded and direct the Wisconsin Neuromorphic Computing & NeuroAI Lab, a university-sanctioned entity with over 100 researchers, where we investigate various NeuroAI topics from neural organoid training to novel deep learning architectures inspired by the primate visual cortex. This work has resulted in four first-author publications at top-tier venues like archival NeurIPS workshps.

Beyond academia, I have translated complex theory into practice as a Research Engineer. At HRL Laboratories, I developed novel optimization passes for a quantum compiler, directly improving algorithmic fidelity on physical quantum hardware. In a stealth-startup role, I led the R&D of a custom AI system from concept to deployment, creating a hardware-aware algorithm that achieved a 100x performance increase over state-of-the-art methods.
