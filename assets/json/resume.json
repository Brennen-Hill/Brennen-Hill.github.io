    "summary": "My goal is to engineer artificial intelligence by using neural computation as a blueprint. I have pursued this by conducting research across three faculty-led labs and by founding a university NeuroAI lab to foster interdisciplinary collaboration. This work has resulted in four first-author, peer-reviewed publications at archival NeurIPS workshops. I aim to apply this synthesis of computational neuroscience and machine learning to tackle fundamental challenges in AI.",
