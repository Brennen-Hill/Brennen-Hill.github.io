To overcome the target hardware’s (Unitree Go1) lack of leg yaw, we introduce a novel passive wheel design called the <strong>“X configuration”</strong>, which enables the conversion of sideways leg motion into forward propulsion. Training is conducted using a massively parallel RL framework in the Isaac Gym simulator. The trained policy discovers complex and <strong>emergent gaits</strong>, automatically switching from a <strong>diagonal gait</strong> at 1 m/s to a <strong>galloping gait</strong> to achieve 3 m/s. We demonstrate that this learned roller-skating locomotion is significantly <strong>more energy-efficient</strong> than a traditional trotting gait, exhibiting a substantially lower cost of transport and mechanical power at equivalent speeds.

Introduction</h2> <h3 id="a-motivation">A. Motivation</h3> <p>Energy efficiency remains a critical challenge in legged robotics. While legged robots offer unparalleled all-terrain mobility, their modes of locomotion, such as trotting or walking, are often energetically expensive. One promising solution is hybrid wheeled-legged robots, but existing designs frequently rely on <strong>actuated wheels</strong>, which add significant cost, complexity, and weight to the system.</p> <p>This project explores an alternative: equipping a quadruped robot with <strong>passive, unactuated roller skates</strong>. This approach maintains the low cost and mechanical simplicity of a purely legged system while offering the potential for high <strong>energy efficiency</strong> on flat surfaces.</p> <p>However, controlling such a system is highly non-trivial. The dynamics of roller skating—generating forward motion from sideways leg pushes—are complex and difficult to model or hand-engineer. We turn to <strong>deep reinforcement learning (RL)</strong> as a data-driven approach to master this skill. By defining a suitable reward structure, RL allows the robot to <em>discover</em> optimal control policies and complex gaits automatically.</p> <h3 id="b-related-previous-work">B. Related Previous Work</h3> <p>Our work is built upon <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">legged_gym</code></strong> [1], a state-of-the-art RL codebase for legged locomotion. It leverages the NVIDIA Isaac Gym physics simulator, which enables massively parallel training of thousands of robots, allowing policies to be trained in minutes.</p> <p>While <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">legged_gym</code> and similar frameworks have successfully trained robots to walk, run, and trot, our <strong>primary contribution lies in the behavior side</strong>. We adapt this framework to a novel hardware configuration: a Unitree Go1 quadruped modified with passive roller skates. This paper focuses on designing the system, developing the RL framework to train it, and analyzing the resulting emergent roller-skating behavior. This provides a new benchmark for energy-efficient locomotion, comparing it against both traditional trotting gaits and more complex actuated wheeled-legged robots.</p> <h3 id="c-objectives">C. Objectives</h3> <p>The primary objectives of this project are:</p> <ol> <li>To design and implement a quadruped robot with passive wheels in simulation, including a novel wheel configuration to overcome the hardware’s mechanical constraints.</li> <li>To develop a deep reinforcement learning framework, including observation spaces, action spaces, and a reward function, to train the robot to roller skate.</li> <li>To demonstrate that the trained policy can achieve stable, high-speed locomotion and track varying velocity commands.</li> <li>To analyze the emergent gaits discovered by the RL agent at different speeds.</li> <li>To quantify and compare the energy efficiency of the learned roller-skating gait against a traditional trotting gait.</li> </ol> <h3 id="d-overview-of-the-report">D. Overview of the Report</h3> <p>The remainder of this report is organized as follows. Section II provides a brief background on reinforcement learning in the context of this problem. Section III details our methodology, including the hardware setup, software architecture, and the design of the RL observation, action, and reward spaces. Section IV presents our results, including maximum achieved speeds, analysis of emergent gaits, and a quantitative comparison of energy efficiency. Section V discusses key implementation challenges, such as friction simulation, and limitations of the current work. Finally, Section VI concludes the report and suggests avenues for future research.</p> <hr> <h2 id="ii-background-reinforcement-learning">II. Background: Reinforcement Learning</h2> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an <strong>agent</strong> (the robot’s control policy) learns to interact with an <strong>environment</strong> (the physics simulation) to maximize a cumulative <strong>reward</strong> signal. At each timestep, the agent observes the environment’s current <strong>state</strong> $s_t$, takes an <strong>action</strong> $a_t$, and receives a scalar reward $r_t$ and the next state $s_{t+1}$. The goal is to learn a <strong>policy</strong>, $\pi(a_t</td> <td>s_t)$, which is a mapping from states to actions that optimizes the expected long-term return (sum of rewards). In this work, we use RL to discover the complex sequence of motor commands required to achieve stable and efficient roller skating, a task that would be exceptionally difficult to explicitly program.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <hr> <h2 id="iii-methodology">III. Methodology</h2> <h3 id="a-hardware-setup">A. Hardware Setup</h3> <p>The robot used in this project is the <strong>Unitree Go1</strong> quadruped. It features 12 motors, with 3 motors on each leg: a <strong>hip motor</strong> (roll), a <strong>thigh motor</strong> (pitch), and a <strong>calf motor</strong> (pitch).</p> <p>The key to human roller skating is the ability to rotate the foot (yaw) to couple sideways motion with forward motion. However, the Go1’s legs are mechanically constrained; they cannot yaw and are always parallel to the robot’s base x-axis.</p> <p>To solve this, we designed a fixed <strong>“X Configuration”</strong> for the passive wheels. As shown in Fig. 1, each wheel is installed with a <strong>fixed 30-degree yaw angle</strong> relative to the body’s x-axis. This configuration is symmetric left-to-right and front-to-back, allowing sideways pushes from any leg to be converted into forward motion.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/12-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/12-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/12-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/12.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Fig 1.

Energy Efficiency Comparison</h3> <p>To validate our primary motivation, we compared the energy efficiency of our roller-skating robot against a baseline <strong>trotting</strong> gait (where the robot steps without wheels rolling). We compared two key metrics:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Mechanical Power ($p$):</strong> Defined as the sum of absolute joint power. We use the absolute value as both positive and negative power draw from the battery (representing electricity consumption). \(p = \sum_{i=1}^{n\_j} |\tau_i \dot{q}_i|\)</li> <li> <strong>Cost of Transport (CoT):</strong> A normalized metric for efficiency. \(CoT = \frac{p}{mg||\mathbf{v}_{xy}||_2}\)</li> </ol> <p>The results, shown in Fig. 7, are conclusive. At all tested forward velocities (1 m/s, 2 m/s, and 3 m/s), the roller-skating gait (red line) is <strong>significantly more energy-efficient</strong> than the trotting gait (black line). Both the peak and average mechanical power and cost of transport are substantially lower when skating.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/12-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/12-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/12-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/12.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Fig 7.

Friction Simulation</h3> <p>A major technical challenge arose during simulation. Initially, after adding rollers, the robot refused to skate and instead learned to trot, as if the wheels were not present. We discovered this was due to <strong>improper simulation of rolling friction</strong> in Isaac Gym. The simulator greatly exaggerates rolling friction when the wheel’s collision geometry is not an ideal sphere. We tested several geometries:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Wheel Mesh:</strong> Failed. The mesh was not a perfect circular object.</li> <li> <strong>Cylinder:</strong> Failed. Isaac Gym converts cylinders to meshes for simulation, leading to the same issue.</li> <li> <strong>Sphere:</strong> Succeeded. Using a sphere as the collision geometry for the wheel resulted in realistic rolling friction and enabled the skating behavior to be learned.</li> </ul> <h3 id="b-whole-body-engagement">B. Whole Body Engagement</h3> <p>A limitation of our current reward function is that tracking rewards are applied only to the robot’s base, not its whole body. This can lead to a phenomenon where the robot <strong>tilts its entire body slightly to one side</strong> while keeping its base perfectly horizontal to satisfy the reward function.</p> <p>A potential solution for future work is to incorporate whole-body level rewards, such as tracking the centroidal linear and angular momentum [2] or the center-of-mass position and whole-body orientation [3].</p> <hr> <h2 id="vi-conclusion">VI. Conclusion</h2> <p>In this project, we successfully demonstrated that a quadruped robot can be trained to roller skate using deep reinforcement learning. By designing a novel <strong>“X configuration” for passive wheels</strong>, we overcame the hardware limitations of the Unitree Go1 robot and enabled it to convert sideways leg motion into forward propulsion.</p> <p>Our RL agent, trained in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">legged_gym</code> simulator [1], learned to locomote at speeds up to 3 m/s and developed complex, <strong>emergent gaits</strong>, automatically switching from a diagonal gait at low speeds to a galloping gait at higher speeds. Furthermore, our analysis shows that this roller-skating gait is <strong>significantly more energy-efficient</strong> than traditional trotting, as measured by both mechanical power and cost of transport.</p> <p>We also identified and solved key simulation challenges related to rolling friction and identified limitations in our current reward function that can lead to whole-body tilt, suggesting clear avenues for future work. This work validates passive roller skating as a viable, low-cost, and highly efficient locomotion strategy for legged robots.</p> <hr> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p>[1] N. Rudin, D.
