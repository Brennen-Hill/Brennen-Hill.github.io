The game featured AI-driven monster agents that used complex pathfinding algorithms to navigate dynamic 3D environments and make strategic targeting decisions; complex player abilities including harvesting resources, crafting equipment, and placing structures; and representing a unique mix of PvE, survival, resource management, and tower defense.
