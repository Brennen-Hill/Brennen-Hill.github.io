### The Invitation

After contacting the workshop organizer, Dr. Dmitri Strukov (UCSB), regarding my research interests, I was invited to attend the NSF BRAID Workshop and encouraged to submit this work. My paper was accepted for a presentation.

This was a highly selective event. I was one of only two undergraduates in attendance, presenting alongside a cohort comprised primarily of principal investigators.
