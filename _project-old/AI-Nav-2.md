### Novel Hardware-Aware Algorithm for High-Precision State Estimation

**Role:** Sole Research Engineer
**Period:** May 2025 – Present

### Objective

To research, design, and deploy a production-ready system for high-precision state estimation on a mobile robotics platform. The project began as an ambiguous high-level goal and was delivered as a fully-deployed, mission-critical system.

### Challenges

- **Severe Hardware Constraints:** The platform's on-board sensors are resource-constrained and provide low-accuracy, high-noise data.
- **SOTA Benchmarking & Failure:** I conducted a comprehensive literature review, implementing and benchmarking numerous state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. These methods failed, yielding localization errors of only ~1000 meters.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** The SOTA methods were fundamentally unsuited for our problem, as they are (1) designed for high-fidelity sensors, not noisy data, and (2) optimized for stationary receivers, whereas our platform is highly dynamic and mobile.

### Methodology & Solution

Given the failure of existing methods, I devised a custom, hardware-aware algorithm from first principles. My research and development process involved:

1.  **Novel Algorithm Design (Manifold Disentanglement):** The core innovation is a novel manifold disentanglement technique. Instead of solving the high-dimensional state estimation problem directly (which is highly sensitive to sensor noise), my algorithm first reframes the problem onto a robust, lower-dimensional manifold. This intermediate step is robust to noise and its output is then used to solve the full state estimation problem.

2.  **Dynamic Platform Accommodation:** The algorithm was designed from the ground up to explicitly account for a dynamic, mobile platform, a key differentiator from most SOTA methods.

3.  **Prototyping & Validation:** I developed initial prototypes in Python to validate the theory against simulated data. After success, I built a robust data pipeline to ingest, process, and replay historical telemetry data from thousands of real-world operational runs, enabling massive-scale regression testing.

4.  **Production Implementation:** The final, high-performance algorithm was implemented in Lisp. This system was rigorously validated through a multi-stage pipeline, progressing from high-fidelity simulation to extensive on-hardware performance analysis to prove its real-world robustness.

### Technology Stack

- **Lisp:** Used for the core, on-device, high-performance algorithm. Selected for its high-speed execution, low-level customizability, and powerful metaprogramming capabilities, which enabled rapid debugging and iterative development directly on the running system.
- **Python:** Used for all data pipelines, simulation, benchmarking, prototyping, and validation.

### Results & Impact

- **Performance:** The custom algorithm achieved a **>100x improvement** in state estimation accuracy over the SOTA baseline, reducing localization error from ~1000 meters to **<10 meters**.
- **Deployment:** The system is now deployed on 100% of the company's devices and is a foundational, mission-critical component of the platform's autonomous capabilities.

### Current & Future Work

I am currently leading the effort to extend this system for "state-anchoring"—developing a method to identify, track, and re-identify persistent environmental features to provide a consistent global reference frame, further enhancing long-term navigation precision.
